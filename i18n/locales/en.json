          "title": "No-Frills Simplicity",
          "p1": "Supertext's platform is built for professional workflows with features most casual users will never touch. Helvetra is intentionally simple: paste text, get translation, done. No account required for basic use, no learning curve, no complexity."

      "swissGermanIrony": {
        "title": "The Swiss German Question",
        "intro": "Let's address the elephant in the room. Supertext is a proudly Swiss company, founded in Zurich, serving Swiss clients. Yet they don't support Swiss German. Why? Because Swiss German is genuinely difficult for translation services.",
        "supertext": {
          "title": "Why Supertext skips Swiss German",
          "point1": "No standardized written form makes training AI models challenging",
          "point2": "Regional variations (Zurich vs Bern vs Basel) multiply complexity",
          "point3": "Their human translators work with standard written languages"
        },
        "helvetra": {
          "title": "Why Helvetra tackles it anyway",
          "point1": "Swiss German is core to Swiss identity, someone needs to solve it",
          "point2": "Apertus (Swiss AI) was trained with Swiss German data",
          "point3": "We offer dialect selection to handle regional variations"
        },
        "conclusion": "We won't claim our Swiss German translation is perfect. It's a hard problem. But we're the only ones working on it, and we're improving with every user feedback submission."

      "pricingSection": {
        "title": "Pricing Comparison",
        "intro": "The pricing models are fundamentally different. Supertext charges by files, targeting document workflows. Helvetra charges by characters, targeting text translation.",

          "title": "Supertext Pricing",
          "point1": "Free: 3,000 characters trial",

          "point3": "Advanced: CHF 24.90/mo (60 files)",
          "point4": "Pro: CHF 49.90/mo (120 files)"

        "helvetraPricing": {
          "title": "Helvetra Pricing",

          "point2": "Helvetra+: CHF 4.99/mo (500K characters)",
          "point3": "No file limits, just character counts"
        },
        "conclusion": "For document-heavy professional use, Supertext's file-based pricing might make sense. For everyday text translation, Helvetra's character-based model is more economical and predictable."
