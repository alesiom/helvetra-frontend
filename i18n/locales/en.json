        },
        "dataStorage": {
          "q": "Where is my data stored?",
          "a": "Your data is not stored. Text is sent to Infomaniak servers in Switzerland where Apertus processes it and returns the translation. Nothing is saved."

          "q": "Is Helvetra free?",

          "q": "Does Helvetra really understand Swiss German?",
