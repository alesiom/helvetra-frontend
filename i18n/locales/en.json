        "languages": {
          "q": "What languages does Helvetra support?",
          "a": "German, Swiss German (with regional dialects), French, Italian, Romansh, and English to start. More languages coming soon."
        },
        "dataStorage": {
          "q": "Where is my data stored?",
          "a": "Your data is not stored. Text is sent to Infomaniak servers in Switzerland where Apertus processes it and returns the translation. Nothing is saved."
        },
        "free": {
          "q": "Is Helvetra free?",
          "a": "This first version is free. A full-featured version may be released later if there's enough interest."
        },
        "different": {
          "q": "What makes Helvetra different from Google Translate or DeepL?",
          "a": "No tracking, and your data stays in Switzerland — not the US (Google) or the EU (DeepL). Plus a single-purpose focus on translation, no distractions."
        },
        "swissGerman": {
          "q": "Does Helvetra really understand Swiss German?",
          "a": "As much as Apertus allows, yes. Helvetra relies on Apertus for translations and cannot guarantee or be held accountable for results."
        },
        "dataTraining": {
          "q": "Is my data used to train AI models?",
          "a": "No. Helvetra does not use your data in any form."

        "apertus": {
          "q": "What is Apertus?",
          "a": "Apertus is Switzerland's open-source AI language model, developed by ETH Zurich, EPFL, and CSCS. Trained on over 15 trillion tokens across 1,000+ languages — including Swiss German and Romansh — it's built for transparency and the public good.
