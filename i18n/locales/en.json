          "p1": "Google Translate has no character limits, no daily caps, and no premium tier you're being nudged toward. You can translate entire documents, websites, even real-time conversations — all without paying a cent or creating an account. This is possible because Google's business model doesn't rely on charging for translation; it relies on the data you provide while using the service."

Point your phone camera at a sign in a foreign language and see the translation overlaid in real-time. Have a conversation with someone who speaks a different language using the app's conversation mode. If you live in Google's ecosystem, the convenience is hard to beat."

          "title": "Privacy as a Foundation, Not a Feature",
          "p1": "This is the fundamental difference between us. Google Translate is a free service because you pay with your data. Your translations can be stored, analyzed, and used to train Google's AI models. For casual use — looking up a word, translating a menu — this is a fair trade for most people.",
          "p2": "But what about translating a confidential business email? A legal document? Personal medical information? A love letter? This is where Helvetra's approach matters. We don't store your translations. We don't use them for training. They're processed on Swiss servers by Swiss AI and immediately deleted. Swiss privacy law — which is stricter than GDPR — applies to everything we do."

This isn't just a badge — it's a fundamentally different approach to AI. Apertus is open-source, research-driven, and built for transparency rather than profit extraction.",
          "p2": "When you use Helvetra, you're supporting the Swiss technology ecosystem instead of feeding more data to Big Tech. Your translations help fund Swiss research and infrastructure, not advertising algorithms in California."

Helvetra is currently the only tool that can translate to and from Swiss German, with support for regional dialects like Zürich, Bern, Basel, and more. The quality is still improving — Swiss German is genuinely hard — but we're the only ones working on it."

There's no account required for basic use, no ads, no dark patterns trying to upsell you, no features you'll never use cluttering the interface. Google Translate has grown increasingly complex over the years — conversation mode, camera translation, saved translations, starred phrases, integration with dozens of other services. If you just want to paste some text and get a translation, Helvetra gets out of your way."
